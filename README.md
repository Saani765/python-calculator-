![calculator-with-some-animated-tech-stuff](https://github.com/Saani765/python-calculator-/assets/98387792/4b2108bc-a7e0-47f0-8cdb-a4f95b9aad50)

üìëSummary:
The Python Calculator project is a command-line application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It utilizes a stack data structure to efficiently handle the calculation process.

üîëKey Features:

üßë‚Äçü¶∞User Input: The calculator prompts the user to enter an arithmetic expression to evaluate.

Tokenization: The input expression is tokenized, breaking it down into individual components such as numbers, operators, and parentheses.

Operator Precedence: The calculator respects the operator precedence rules, ensuring correct evaluation of the expression.

Stack Implementation: A stack data structure is utilized to store and manipulate the tokens during the evaluation process.

Evaluation: The calculator processes the tokens and performs the arithmetic operations using the stack, following the rules of operator precedence.

Error Handling: The calculator includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs, such as division by zero or malformed expressions.

Interactive Experience: After evaluating the expression, the calculator displays the result to the user and provides the option to perform additional calculations or exit the program.

‚ûïBenefits:

Efficiency: The stack data structure allows efficient handling of complex arithmetic expressions by utilizing the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

Extensibility: The project can be extended to support additional operations or functionalities, such as handling variables or trigonometric functions.

Learning Opportunity: Implementing the calculator using a stack provides a practical application for understanding and working with data structures in Python.
